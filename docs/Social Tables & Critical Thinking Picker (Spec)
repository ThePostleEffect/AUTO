🎯 Purpose

The Social Hall is AUTO’s casual but purposeful community space. Instead of random chatrooms, users join Tables — small groups designed for conversation, debate, and problem-solving. It blends the fun of hanging out with the challenge of exercising your mind.

🪑 Tables

Each Table = a virtual “library table” (chat + optional voice/video).

Anyone can join, but each Table has a max size (e.g., 6–8 people).

Tables are topic-neutral until activated. Conversation can be casual, but the design nudges toward learning.

🧠 Crit Think Picker

Once a Table has 4+ participants, anyone can trigger the Crit Think Picker.

Picker presents a prompt/challenge (could be logic puzzles, ethical dilemmas, science/tech questions, scenario-solving).

A timer starts (e.g., 10–15 minutes).

The group must collaborate to find a solution before time runs out.

🎮 Win / Lose State

Victory (solution found before time) →

Table receives points/credits.

Credits can be used for fun:

cosmetic upgrades (skins, notebook covers, custom avatars)

gifting to Scholars or peers

access to bonus features.

Defeat (time expires) → no reward, but users can try again.

⚖️ Culture

“Bullshitting around” is fine in Social Hall, but the purpose is enrichment.

AUTO ensures that even fun conversations lean toward critical thinking, problem-solving, and learning.

The Crit Think Picker acts as the engine that transforms casual chats into learning games.

Lobby → list of Tables.

Join button → Table chat/voice view.

Crit Think Picker button (visible only if 4+ users).

Timer countdown UI.

Backend (Supabase or Node/Express)

tables table (id, participants, status).

crit_think_sessions (id, table_id, prompt_id, started_at, ends_at, outcome).

rewards (user_id, session_id, credits).

Realtime (Socket.io/Supabase Realtime)

Sync chat, table membership, timers, victory state across all users live.

📊 Data Model (simplified)

tables

id, title, max_participants, created_at

table_participants

id, table_id, user_id, joined_at

crit_think_sessions

id, table_id, prompt_id, started_at, ends_at, status (active|won|lost)

rewards

id, user_id, session_id, credits, created_at

🔮 Future Add-ons

Leaderboard → show top thinkers/teams.

Badges → earned for streaks, unique problem types, or creativity.

Scholar-created prompts → Scholars can drop in challenges for bonus credit.

👉 Here’s what I’d suggest for your next commit workflow:

Add a short section in README called Social Hall & Tables with a 2–3 sentence description + link.

Create a file docs/social-tables.md with this full spec.

(Optional) Add a ROADMAP.md update showing v1 = tables + chat, v2 = Crit Think Picker, v3 = rewards/credits.
